Design your own Turkish programming langauage.

The steps required:

* The state diagrams should be drawn for important structures of the language.
* You must generate 4 examples of source codes designed in your programming language.
* The examples should include assignment, arithmetic expression and variable definition.
* These example code files should be read by your modified lex and syntax analysis source codes.
* The modified code should give a proper output for the input source codes of your language.
